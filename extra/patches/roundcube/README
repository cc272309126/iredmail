- roundcube-CVE-2010-0464.patch (2010-02-28)

  Roundcube 0.3.1 and earlier does not request that the web browser avoid
  DNS prefetching of domain names contained in e-mail messages, which makes
  it easier for remote attackers to determine the network location of the
  webmail user by logging DNS requests.
